    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a free software enthusiast and software developer. I was introduced
        to Linux in 2012 by my younger brother. It was a long painful journey
        but I eventually learned to love Linux for the customizability,
        elegence, and effeciency of the workflows I could achieve while using
        Linux. I loved my Linux workflows so much in fact, that I have
        completely removed proprietary operating systems from all of my
        personal computers. Like most Linux users, I have a distro hopping
        addiction but in recent years have mostly cured myself and settled
        on Arch and Gentoo due to the fact that they provide a minimal install
        and which provides high ammounts of customizability without having to
        undo things that were done automatically during a less minimal install.
    </p>
    <h2>Software Choices:</h2>
    <p>
        Even though it's kind of a meme, I've found myself using more and more
        <a href="https://www.suckless.org">Suckless Software</a>. This is
        because it is extremely minimalist. I would personally prefer to patch
        in functionality that I want rather than have all functionality built
        in and have it bloat the codebase. I have custom builds of
        <a href="https://github.com/lannuttia/dwm">dwm</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/lannuttia/st">st</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/lannuttia/dmenu">dmenu</a>,
        <a href="https://github.com/lannuttia/slock">slock</a>,
        and <a href="https://github.com/lannuttia/tabbed">tabbed</a>.
        I also have a
        <a href="https://github.com/lannuttia/dotfiles">dotfiles repository</a>
        that I use for bootstrapping systems with my personal configurations as
        well as installing my custom builds.
    </p>
    <h2>Philosophies:</h2>
    <p>
      My software choices are as much philosophically driven as they are driven
      by practical reasons. When I'm choosing what software to use, I have a
      checklist of desireable qualities that I look for.
      <h3>Desirable Qualities:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Open Source</li>
        <li>Minimalistic</li>
        <li>Highly extensible</li>
      </ul>
      I prefer to use open source software because I like to do what I can to
      avoid being tied into a specific platform whenever possible. Closed
      source software leads to uneccesary vendor lock and when it comes to
      software, I think the less vendor lock you have, the safer you are in the
      long term. I prefer minimalistic software because code is debt. If a
      piece of software has a large feature set, it becomes more difficult to
      maintain and configure. Before a piece of software starts to acquire a
      large feature set, I think it is important for the people managing the
      architecture to ask themselves if there is a more modular, extensible
      solution than coupling that feature to that existing piece of software.
      I prefer to use highly extnensible software for a variety of reasons.
      A piece of software being highly extensible prevents the need for code
      duplication which in turn makes it cheaper and easier to maintain. It
      also aids in preventing vendor lock because when pieces are small, they
      are easier to replace and reason about.
